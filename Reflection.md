# What I Found Easy and Hard about the Project

1. I found it easy to build the machine. There were many websites that I used to learn about how each component worked.
2. I found it hard to make the flow chart. I didn't realize how a flow chart worked. I also looked a wrong example in how to create a circut diagram. (no arrows allowed)
